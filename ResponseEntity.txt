An HTTP status code is a three-digit numeric code returned by a web server as part of the response to an HTTP request made by a client.

These status codes are used to convey information about the result or status of the requested operation.

HTTP status codes are grouped into five categories based on their first digit
lxx (Informational) : These status codes indicate that the request was received and understood, and the server is continuing to process it. These are typically used for informational purposes and 
                      rarely seen in practice.


2xx (Successful) : These status codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed by the serve

200 0K: The request has been successfully processed, and the server is returning the requested resource.
201 Created: The request has been fulfilled, and a new resource has been created as a result.
204 No Content: The request was successful, but there is no response body (typically used for operations that don't return data, like a successful deletion).


3xx (Redirection): These status codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request. They are used when the client needs to take additional steps to access the requested resource.

301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a different URL.
302 Found : The HTTP status code 302 indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to a different URL. When a server sends a response with a 302 status code, it typically includes a 
            Location header field that specifies the new temporary URL where the client should redirect to.
304 Not Modified: The client's cached version of the requested resource is still valid, so the server sends this status code to indicate that the client can use its cached copy.


4xx (Client Error) : These status codes indicate that there was an error on the client's part, such as a malformed request or authentication issues.

400 Bad Request: The server cannot understand or process the client's request due to invalid syntax or other client-side issues.
401 Unauthorized: The client needs to provide authentication credentials to access the requested resource.
403 Forbidden: The client is authenticated, but it does not have permission to access the requested resource.


5xx (Server Error) : These status codes indicate that there was an error on the server's part while trying to fulfill the request.

500 Internal Server Error: A generic error message indicating that something went wrong on the server, and the server could not handle the request.
502 Bad Gateway: The server acting as a gateway or proxy received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overloading or maintenance.



ResponseEntity
The ResponseEntity class is part of the Spring Framework and is commonly used in Spring Boot applications to customize the HTTP response.

It provides methods for setting the response status, headers, and body. You can use it to return different types of data in your controller methods, such as JSON, XML, or even HTML.

You can use generics with ResponseEntity to specify the type of data you are returning.
